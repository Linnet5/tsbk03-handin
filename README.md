# Holmgang Level Editor (Code Only)

In this repo, you'll find the code for the level editor part of the game holmgang. The level editor was made during the course TSBK03 and uses Wave Function Collapse to procedurally generate the stage depending on player input.


Made by Linus Karlsson (linka107) & Emil Bertholdsson (emibe986) during the course TSBK03 at LIU.
